Silicon detectors play a crucial role in high energy physics experiments. In future high energy physics experiments, silicon detectors will be exposed to extremely high fluence environment, which can significantly affect their performance. It is important to understand the electrical behavior  of detectors after irradiation. In this study, an irradiation simulation framework is constructed in RAdiation SEmiconductoR (RASER) to simulate leakage current and charge collection effciency. The defect parameters are obtained from the Hamburg penta trap model (HPTM). Based on this work, we predict the silicon inner tracker which under a ten-year Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) Higgs mode run can still maintain over 90% charge collection efficiency.
